# Eclipse Dataspace Components

**Please note: All content of provided documentation reflects the current state of discussion.**

## Introduction

Data spaces allow organizations to securely share data with others. They enable data cooperation in a multi-cloud
federation by focusing on identity, trust, sovereignty, and interoperability.

- Identity: Each participant remains in control of their identity.
- Trust: Each participant decides who to trust.
- Sovereignty: Each participant decides under what policies their data is shared.
- Interoperability: Each participant remains in control of their deployment.

Since the concept of data spaces is emerging and promises new capabilities to the data exchange between participants
(organizations) in terms of data sovereignty, many may ask the questions "What is a connector?" and "When and why should
I use it?".

**What is a data space connector?**

A participant in a data space wants to share and consume data offers, transfer data, and - most important - maintain
control over its usage. All processes are based on the aforementioned principles of identity, trust, sovereignty, and
interoperability. This is why a connector component is used to participate in a data space and mainly focuses on
these aspects while ensuring data sovereignty along the entire data supply and value chain.

In order to build up and participate in a data space, it is not enough to consider existing communication protocols.
This means, besides the actual data transfer, a connector has to provide capabilities, i.e., for discovering,
connecting, automated contract negotiation, policy enforcement, and auditing processes. Data space connectors act as
logical gatekeepers that integrate into each participantâ€™s infrastructure and communicate with each other.

**When to use a data space connector?**

A connector should be used each time the controlling (legal) entity of the data changes. A connector provides a
generic way to express, negotiate, and document the rules under which data is shared, and also with whom. Not just
in plain text but machine-readable and technically enforceable.

Existing open-source projects address the technical challenges of cataloguing and transferring data for a wide
range of use cases. However, there is no open-source effort aimed at providing an interoperable, cross-organization
framework for data sharing that is built on a common identity model and uniform policy enforcement. This project
will integrate with existing data exchange technologies and provide these missing pieces to create a system for data
sharing where each organization is able to exert control over how its shared data is used.

**About the Eclipse Dataspace Components**

A data-sharing system requires a protocol implementation for policy enforcement among participants. The EDC will
implement the International Data Spaces (IDS) standard as well as relevant protocols and requirements associated
with Gaia-X, and thereby provide implementation and feedback to these initiatives. However, the EDC will be
extensible in a way that it may support alternative protocols.
Its added value is achieved through the separation of control and data plane, which enables a modular and
thereby customizable way to build data spaces. Due to common interfaces and mapping of existing standards, the EDC
adds capabilities of contract negotiating and policy handling in an interoperable manner.

**Open, community-driven and extensible**

As an open source project hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, the EDC provides a growing list of modules for many
widely-deployed cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, OTC, etc.) "out-of-the-box" and can easily be extended for
more customized environments, while avoiding any intellectual property rights (IPR) headaches.

## Statement: EDC vs. DSC

_Also to be read on [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/DataSpaceConnector/discussions/1037)._

**The Eclipse Dataspace Components expand and improve the Dataspace Connector (DSC) as a follow-up development
by an OSS community that is being contributed to the various initiatives that are involved in building data spaces.
Both connectors do _not_ have the same codebase, but follow the same ideas of sovereign data spaces.**

The DSC is a component previously developed by Fraunhofer ISST. The goal was to build an IDS-compliant connector
driven by a community (e.g., from initiatives as Catena-X, Gaia-X, Mobility Data Space) as OSS to foster distribution
and usage. While some discussions with several partner organizations begin/mid last year, it became very clear that
the underlying governance and rules for contributions did not fit the requirements to form such a community and work
on the code together due to questions regarding intellectual property (IP), licensing, etc.

As a solution, partners agreed in June '21 to create a project within the Eclipse Foundation (EF), since EF provides
clear governance structures and rules allowing exactly the collaboration and community building, it was aimed for.
While the transfer process and meetings with initial committers (among others), the architecture was rethought to
directly address future requirements in terms of applicability, robustness, scaling, etc. A much-discussed issue
dealt with the limitation to a single data protocol such as the IDS vs. a solution that can support multiple such
protocols. The decision fell on the latter and so the EDC is now developed based on a new architecture and design
principles but based on available parts (like the DSC) that were transferred as initial contributions to the EF
(see the [project's proposal](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-dataspace-connector)). This time
with a [community of various companies](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.edc/who)
that bring in requirements from different initiatives like Catena-X, Eona-X, IDSA, Gaia-X, or MDS, and work on
a decentralized data space implementation based on a data space connector that provides capabilities for data
exchange and extensibility to various shared service implementations (catalog, identity, usage control, logging, etc.)
through interfaces. Thereby, the EDC can support IDS(A)-based components like the DAPS (Identity), or Metadata Broker
(Catalog) as well as other approaches like WEB-DID (Identity) or Federated Catalog (Catalog). All with the same core
to enable organizations to use a single technology to participate in multiple data spaces/ecosystems/federations in
parallel.
